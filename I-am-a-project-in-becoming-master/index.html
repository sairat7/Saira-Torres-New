<!--Welcome to "I am...a Project in Becoming..." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll design a really cool webtext that not only introduces you to the rest of the class, but also builds your coding literacy. Refer to the repository README for GitHub publishing help.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded code comments be, or delete them. Programmers and web designers use these comments to better explain what the code is doing for others who may enter the document later. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!--Next comes the <head> information including the title and all of the important links that make the webtext work. When a browser access your url, it looks first at the index.html document <head> to learn about the names and locations of the other files and assets it will need to assemble your code into a visual display.-->

  <!--Go ahead and fill in the blank in <title>I am...</title> (see just below). The <title> will appear in your document's browser tab-->
<title>I am...</title>
<!--The stuff below the title does important work to tell browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>


<body>
<!--Now we will start working in the body of the document. The body holds all of the code and content that will appear as a visual for our audience.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

<!--We'll use this first section to discuss where you are right now. Where do you go to school and what courses are you taking/enjoying. What majors/minors/certificates are you pursuing? Has this changed? Why? Replace the content between <h3> and </h3> that says "Lorem ipsum" etc -->


<!--Fuego programs sometimes use "in-line styling" to provide quick fixes to content design. In the above case, you could change "left" to "right" or "center" depending on your specific design needs. That said, left align is usually best practice for improving readability.-->

  <h2>Family</h2>
  <h3>I am from the suburbs of Chicago, in a town named Berwyn, just a 20-minute drive from downtown Chicago. I am half Mexican and half Ukrainian, however I am closer with my Ukrainian side of the family. My family is quite rather small when compared to others. Its only my grandparents, my mom, and I. I also have two dogs named Furby and Teddy and a cat named Simba. I’m an only child, but I like to think of my pets as my siblings. I have no cousins. The rest of my family on my mom’s side is back in Ukraine. I have met some of my family members from there, but not all. Even though it is a rough time right now in Ukraine, my family still has hope and stays strong together as we experience this difficult time. We can only hope and pray that peace will come one day.</h3>

<!--Replace the images here. You can also control max-image width%. Keep your file names simple, don't use spaces, and be case sensitive). Be sure to add alt="text."

<!--Let's go back to the start, to your home and family. Where do you come from? What's it like? Who is your family? I'll let you define these terms. Who are your people? How did these influences impact where you are now?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Hobbies </h2>
    <h3>One of my favorite hobbies that you could find me doing is embroidery. Embroidery is one way for me to relax and relieve stress. I also love nature; on weekends I’ll go with my mom on trails to go biking or walking. When we do go biking, I usually end up waiting for my mom because I always reach the end of the trail before her. Another hobby of mine would be painting, I usually like to paint scenic scenes. When you walk into my home you could tell I have multiple cactuses. Even right now I have six plants in my dorm room. So, you can say I am a big plant person. Hook latch art is a hobby most people have never really heard of, but I love doing it. You basically get a big grid and must match up the colors that they provide. I usually like making pillowcases. Another interest of mine would be baking, when I come home for the holidays, I always end up baking some type of dessert, whether it’s Ukrainian or American I make it.</h3>

<!--Quick fact: Did you know "Lorem ipsum," the fill text used in this web template, was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum"? Developers made it non-sensical, so don't bother with Google Translate.-->



<!--Show us. Find those beautiful, meaningful "family" photos and pictures of your place (only you can define family). If you are concerned about issues of privacy, you can always use stock images, or get creative. Add these photos to your project folder, making sure the files end in .jpg or .png and replace the names in the grid code below. You can add more images if you wish, or subtract...you might also need to move content around to achieve balance. See what happens – sometimes you have to be playful to find the purpose of things. Since these images are smaller, you will want to resize your images to less than 600px in width. This will improve load time and thus general accessibility. Don't forget to add alt="text"-->

<!--A photo grid uses rows and column classes to create some divisions on the page that will scale with mobile devices. The style.css page provides other attributes that will adjust the image depending on the size of screens.-->

  <h2>Violin</h2>
      <h3>When I was young my uncle used to play the violin. I was always fascinated by his playing, and he inspired me to start playing. I started playing the violin when I was in first grade. It was not only until three years later I auditioned to play in the Chicago Youth Symphony Orchestra, and I made it in. In eighth grade I suffered an injury that took me out on medical leave for a year. I went to multiple doctors and in the end no diagnosis was ever made. I was told that I wouldn’t be able to play violin ever again, but I didn’t let that set me back. I took several months of occupational therapy, and I was able to play violin again. I was taken off medical leave and have grown in my technique since then. My first time back after medical leave I was accepted into the Illinois All-District Orchestra. I have been awarded as an Illinois All-District Musician for three years in a row now. I have overcome my injury and showed the doctors that I could once again play the violin. I continued to do what I love most, playing the violin again.</h3>
